            <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
            Spray a baking pan with vegetable oil spray.
            </li>
            <li>
            Place frozen chicken fillets on the prepared pan and bake for 10 to 12 minutes.
            Turn chicken, sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese on each fillet, and bake until crispy, an additional 10 to 12 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
            Slice garlic bread into 4 equal portions.
            Open each portion and place garlic side up on a baking sheet.
            Warm garlic bread in the oven about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
            To assemble the sandwiches, place a chicken fillet on a piece of garlic bread, spoon 1/4 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce on top of the chicken, and lay a slice of provolone on top of the sauce.
            Place 3 basil leaves, or more to taste, on each sandwich, and top with the other half.
            </li>
            <li>
            Wrap each sandwich in foil and return to the oven until the cheese is melted, 5 to 8 minutes.
            Unwrap and serve warm.
